#data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair in four days. This was the first project starting the second day at Hack Reactor. Instantiation patterns include functional, functional-shared, prototypal, and pseudoclassical. Data structures include set, linked list, binary tree, hashtables, and graphs.
